Configure Plugins
=================

You need to create two plugins: The searchbox and the resultlist.

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

   #. Create a plugin :guilabel:`Faceted Search: Show searchbox and filters` on the page `Search`

      Fill in the field :guilabel:`Record Storage Page` in the Tab :guilabel:`Plugin` > :guilabel:`General` with
      the folder that you created in step 2 (our example: `Search data`).

         :alt: Plugin tab on "searchbox and filters" plugin
         :class: with-border

      .. hint::
         It is useful to give the plugin :guilabel:`Searchbox and Filters` a header (our example:
         `Searchbox`, can also set to `hidden`):

         That makes it easier to identify the correct content element in the next step.

   #. Create a plugin :guilabel:`Faceted Search: Show resultlist` on the page `Search`

      In the field :guilabel:`Load FlexForm config from this search box` fill in the Search-Plug-In that you created in
      the previous step (our example: `Searchbox`).

      .. figure:: /Images/QuickStart/plugins-5.png
         :alt: Plugin tab
         :class: with-border

      After this steps, you should have two plugins on your search page.

Create the indexer configuration
================================

Use the :guilabel:`List` module to create an indexer configuration on the page `Search data`.

.. figure:: /Images/QuickStart/indexer-configuration-1.png

* Choose a title.
* Set the :guilabel:`Type` to `Pages`.
* Set the :guilabel:`Storage` to your folder `Search data`.
* Choose the pages you wish to index. You can decide whether the indexing process runs on all pages recursively or
  if only one page will be indexed. You can combine both fields.
