Why not use InnoDB for the index table?
=======================================

The storage engine for the index table (`tx_kesearch_index`) is MyISAM while all other tables use the default InnoDB storage engine.
Unfortunately this prevents using ke_search in Galera Clusters.

The reasons are explained below.

If the behaviour explained below does not affect how you use ke_search, you may switch to InnoDB for `tx_kesearch_index`.

Search for @-character ist not supported
========================================

You cannot search for the "at"-Character in InnoDB tables:

    InnoDB full-text search does not support the use of the @ symbol in boolean full-text searches.
    The @ symbol is reserved for use by the @distance proximity search operator.

Phrase search is not supported
==============================

Phrase search using double quotes ("my search word") is not supported in InnoDB.
